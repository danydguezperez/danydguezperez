### Hi there, Iâ€™m Dany ðŸ‘‹
- I am a biologist with a PhD from the University of Porto, Portugal, where I acquired knowledge and skills on proteomics, transcriptomics, and bioinformatics approaches. I also hold a degree in biology from Havana University, Cuba, and a diploma in higher education from Universidad Central de Las Villas, Cuba.
- ðŸ”¬Iâ€™m currently working as Research fellow at Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn, in the project CRIMAC DEEPVEN project aiming to characterize the diversity and activity of deep-sea Anthozoa venoms.
- I am passionate about biodiscovery, especially in the benefits of multi-omics for biomarker and bioactive peptide discovery with a wide range of biomedical and industrial applications. I am currently involved as Founder in a personal project PagBiOMICs: Personalised Academic Guidance and Biodiscovery-integrated OMICs Solutions.
