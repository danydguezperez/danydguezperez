### Hi there, I’m Dany 👋
- I am a biologist 🐠🐞🐛🦋🐝🐬🦅🐸 with a PhD from the [University of Porto](https://sigarra.up.pt/fcup/pt/web_page.inicial), Portugal, where I acquired knowledge and skills on proteomics, transcriptomics, and bioinformatics approaches. I also hold a degree in biology from Havana University, Cuba, and a diploma in higher education from Universidad Central de Las Villas, Cuba.
- I’m currently working as Research fellow at [Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn](https://szn.it/index.php/it/) ![stazione_zoologica_anton_dohrn](https://github.com/danydguezperez/danydguezperez/assets/63007276/8a7abfc5-e471-49b0-b77e-946fbce2d53c), in the CRIMAC DEEPVEN project aiming to characterize the diversity and activity of deep-sea Anthozoa venoms 🪸.
- I am passionate about biodiscovery 🔬, especially in the benefits of OMICs approaches for biomarker and bioactive peptide discovery with a wide range of biomedical and industrial applications 🦟🦑🦂🐚🐍. I have participated in several research projects such as related to bioactive peptides, biotoxins, and biomarkers involving at prestigious institutions such as [European Marine Biological Resource Centre](https://www.embrc.eu/) (EMBRC-PT), MOREBIVALVES - "Molecular strategies to be applied in the depuration of commercial bivalves for the elimination of toxic compounds", at a [CIIMAR - Interdisciplinary Centre of Marine and Environmental Research](https://www.ciimar.up.pt/).
- 🌱 first steps in a personal project [PagBiOMICs](https://www.pagbiomics.com/): Personalised Academic Guidance and Biodiscovery-integrated OMICs Solutions.
